Note: there are two versions of the code in the repository. The "master" branch
uses [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

This version, which uses the [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library
instead, is the work of people at U. Freiburg and Kuka, including 
[Christoph Sprunk](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~sprunkc/) 
and [Rainer Kuemmerle](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~kuemmerl/).
